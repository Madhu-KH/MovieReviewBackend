# MovieReviewBackend
This project is a backend web API designed for managing movie reviews. It features two primary entities: Movie and Review, which are handled via Entity Framework Core using the code-first approach. The API allows users to submit and retrieve reviews for movies, providing basic authentication for secure access.
